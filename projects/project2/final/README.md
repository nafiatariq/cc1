Artistâ€™s statement
-Nafia Tariq

City Escape is a game about a plane that is trying to fly through the city
without having to touch any building or bird. All the illustrations are made
by myself and I kept the colours bright to make it look more fun and appealing.
Also, the song fits in perfectly with the imagery of the game and the feeling I
was aiming for.

I want the user to feel comfortable when starting the game but feel more and
more captivated when the speed increases. Even the slight touch against a bird
makes you lose and you need to restart the game. As the buildings are
different heights, you need to keep going up and down but you need to be careful
about the birds in the sky!

City Escape can easily be played by anyone, and the instructions speak for
themselves. Although it might be a simple game for others, I tried my best to
add details to make things more interesting. I wanted to birds to look more
realistic by being in groups and having movements. As for the buildings, they
come in randomly in different sizes which is always intriguing to see and
harder to avoid. When you touch any of those element, there is an ending sound
that plays to finish it up.

I enjoyed programming this and tried my best to create something that is fully
functional and nice to look at. Have fun playing and make sure to fly safely!
