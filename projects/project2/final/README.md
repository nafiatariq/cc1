Artistâ€™s statement
- Nafia Tariq

City Escape is a game about a plane which is trying to fly through the city
without touching any building nor bird. All the illustrations are made by myself
and I kept the colours bright to make it look more fun and appealing. The song
fits in perfectly with the imagery of the game.

I want the user to feel comfortable when starting the game but feel more and
more captivated when the speed increases. Even the slight touch against a bird
makes you lose and you need to restart to try again. As the buildings are
different heights, you need to keep going up and down but you need to be careful
about the birds in the sky!
